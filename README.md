Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
          We were given a majority of the code. The environment was set up, all imports were there, and we had supporting py files to use. The code i created is in the 9th cell, which was implementing the Q-training algorithm, "qtrain"
          
Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
          What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
                    Computer scientests have the most straightforward job ever, problem solving. Computer scientists are presented a problem, and they use all of their knowledge of computers to solve the problem. 
                    There is a divide however, some are the researchers which develop new tools, methods, and invent things to solve problems. They are problem solving problem solving. But there's also the business world,
                    where most of us fall. It's this group's job to use those tools to solve real world problems. It matters because the world would stand still if people just gave up, it needs these people. There have always been professional problem
                    Solvers though. A long time ago, Architects were the professional problem solvers because it was a new age and these architects were finding ways to overcome the elements.
          How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
                    I have actually noted in a previus class that my whole problem solving process has changed since starting this degree. Between the content in school and some personal hobbies, I have gained a much better perspective for individual parts.
                    Previously I always saw things as a whole, not as individual pieces interacting with one another. But now i have a very solid process that starts at the smallest level. For example, when my CPU temperatures were
                    abnormally high, my first instinct was to boot into BIOS to get information like idling temps. After that i went to the simplest solution possible and it worked. I turned my pc off and tried to spin the fan with my finger
                    to see if it was mechanically blocked or fried. Then i noticed it somehow came unplugged from the motherboard. The key is to start from the very beginning, the smallest parts, and keeping the solution as simpleminded as possible.
          What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
                    My ethical responsibility to users is to refuse any immoral requests for software development, as well as ensuring to provide a high quality product. To the organization, it is my responsibility
                    to follow company guidelines and industry standard best practices for my work.
